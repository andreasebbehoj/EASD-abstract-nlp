The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of EMPA on CV death , stroke , and all - cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) in the LEADER trial . MATERIALS AND METHODS : This was a 24-week multicentre , multicentre , randomised , parallel - group , placebo - controlled trial . Patients in the LEADER trial were randomized to receive once - weekly placebo , empagliflozin 10 mg , or liraglutide 1.8 mg . Participants were randomized 1:1 to switch 1 mg / day or placebo over 5 weeks . Liraglutide significantly reduced hba1c and body weight by baseline subgroup ( p < 0.001 ) . Changes in hba1c and body weight were also assessed . The primary outcome was time to resolution of MACE ( composite of MACE , MACE and all - cause death ) and hospitalisation for heart failure ( hhf ) by MACE at baseline . Incidence of recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as time to first event of all - cause mortality , subsequent MACE or non - fatal stroke . Results : Included included patients ( n = 12 ) were male ( age 55 ( 65 ) years , mean ( sd ) duration of T2D : 8.0 ( 6.6 ) years , hba1c 8.3 ( 6.4 , 7.6 ) % , age 55 ( 17 ) years , hba1c 6.5 ( 6.5 ) mmol / mol ) , and hba1c 53 ( 41 ) mmol / mol . Among the placebo arm , MACE was only the most efficacious , and the most common outcome was MACE in patients without ( n = 13 ) , sglt2i ( n = 13 ) or placebo ( n = 38 ) . The primary composite endpoint was non - fatal myocardial infarction ( mi ) , stroke ,\n","Metformin is and / or GLP-1 receptor agonists ( sglt2 inhibitors ) are widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) . However , their effectiveness in clinical practice and prognosis is well known , especially regarding their effectiveness . Since sodium glucose co - transporter 2 inhibitors ( sglt2i ) have been shown to reduce postprandial cholesterol levels by inhibiting bile acid synthesis , we have previously shown that SGLT2 inhibitors investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function in diabetic patients with renal impairment . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this blind case control study , we assessed the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function of sitagliptin in patients with T2 dm , renal impairment , renal failure and renal impairment . We assessed the effects of sglt2i ( sglt2i ) , dpp-4i ( dapa ) and dpp-4i ( sitagliptin ) on renal function and renal function in T2 dm patients with or without rasi treatment . Results : Treatment with DAPA 10 mg or placebo was significantly associated with an increase in the incidence of renal replacement treatment ( rr : 1.34 [ 95 % CI : 0.84 - 0.93 ] ) compared with placebo . Significant difference was observed in egfr < 60 ml / min / 1.73 m(2 ) between placebo and SGLT2 inhibitors ( dapagliflozin : ndm - d : -0.5 ml / min / 1.73 m(2 ) , p = 0.002 , Figure ) . Similarly , DAPA induced egfr decline ( ≥90 ml / min / 1.73 m(2 ) : 1.73 m(-2 ) , p<0.001 , Cox regressions : HR 95 % CI : 0.85 - 1.34 ) . CONCLUSION : In T2 dm patients with T2 dm , sglt2i dose was associated with a significant reduction in renal reactivity , as compared with placebo . These effects may be due to a reduction in renal function and a reduction in renal insulin resistance . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : The cause of hypoglycemia in adults is high risk for type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) . Recent evidence suggests a role for these molecules in vascular endothelial growth cells ( angiogenesis\n","Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors ( sglt2 ) are active patients with T2 dm , hypertension is known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . However , the effect of dapagliflozin on its function is unclear . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study was a randomised , placebo - controlled , single - blinded , placebo - controlled study . Patients were randomized to receive placebo or placebo for 30 weeks . The main changes from baseline in hba1c and body weight ( bw ) were assessed using a Cox regression model adjusted for treatment , treatment interaction , and interaction between treatment and subgroup . Changes in body weight ( bw ) and body weight ( bw ) were also evaluated . Results : Treatment was well tolerated , with no significant differences in BMI , weight , and hba1c . At the end of treatment , the total reduction from baseline to Week 24 was 0.9 % and 1.8 % with liraglutide and exercise respectively . Body weight was decreased by 21 % and 27 % in the placebo group , respectively . Weight loss was 3.8 kg , and BW was reduced by 71 % . Body weight reductions were greater in the placebo group than those without placebo at baseline . Body weight reduction was greater in both groups , whereas placebo treatment also increased body weight , body weight , and BW changes . Body weight reductions were greater in the placebo group than in the placebo group ( placebo : wmd 0.42 % , p < 0.05 , placebo : 28.1 % , placebo : 33.4 % , p = 0 . 000 333 ,,, placeboplaceboplacebo andandand placeboplaceboplacebo ::: 1.221.221.22 kgkgkg ,,, ppp <<< 000 ... 333 000 111 ,,, andandand liraglutideliraglutideliraglutide ::: 0.050.050.05 kgkgkg ,,, ppp <<< 000 ... 333 000 111 ))) ... Comparisons of combination therapy and intervention groups were also significant for both groups : body weight decreased by 31.5 kg ( 95%ci : 0.85 to 0.63 ) and weight ( kg : 4.50 kg / m2 , p = 0.004 ) , weight fell by -0.5 kg ( 95%ci : 1.91 to -0.3 ) and weight fell by 1.6 kg ( 95%ci : 1.6 to 1.9\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9G4Bj4bd4Qfe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615996695710,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":962,"user":{"displayName":"Andreas Ebbehøj","photoUrl":"","userId":"08395341979072900138"}}},"source":[""],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]}]}
