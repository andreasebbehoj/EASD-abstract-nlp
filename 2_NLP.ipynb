We have recently observed that the expression of ECM proteins in the pancreas is enhanced in diabetes as has been suggested by the use of the protein 5'-utr . However , the molecular mechanism of this action remains unknown , particularly in beta cells . The present study is designed to MATERIALS AND METHODS : Live cell imaging was performed in alphatc1 cells ( mean number of cells collected from the pancreas of 15 , 28 , 60 , 90 , 90 and 96 cells ) cells . The proliferation and apoptosis were measured by TUNEL , Ki67 and Ki67 staining , respectively . Cell proliferation was measured after cell cycle induction by using the cell viability kit . The same cells were treated with 1 or 7 mm of Insulin for 24 hours or 1 mm , respectively . Cell viability was evaluated by caspase-3 cleavage , cell proliferation by brdu incorporation , and apoptosis by nuclear dyes . Insulin content was measured by RIA . Results : The results showed that in the cell culture medium , insulin secretion was RESULTS : Insulin ( 100 nm ) was required to maintain the cell membrane under the basal conditions , and at high glucose levels . In the presence of insulin , GLP-1 stimulation could be blocked by the addition of IBMX to the insulin . This resulted in a 50 % ( p<0.05 ) increase in cell viability as measured by MTT assay . The proliferation rate was increased by about 50 % in the presence of insulin . Stimulation of cells with GLP-1 reduced cell proliferation by 50 % ( from 56 % to 64 % ) and apoptosis ( from 27 % to 19 % ) , whereas cell proliferation was not affected by insulin . Both GLP-1 and forskolin produced a biphasic , biphasic insulin secretion . The basal expression level of GLP-1 was nearly double that of insulin ( 1 % ) . Incubation of cells with GLP-1 or the GLP-1 analogue Exendin-4 or tolbutamide did not alter the response to CONCLUSION : Both the angiogenic factor GLP-1 and the insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor ( glp-1r ) were expressed in both cell types .
